detail about many things i spoke with a friend of mine in america this morning and he made a suggestion to me that i wanna share with you in a moment but i wanna and by you first to consider this idea in this in in the context of what we're already talking about which i'm i'm thinking specifically about your feedback on the you tube videos us your desire to or or your incur judgment for me to consider having a tick tock channel and so i think maybe these three things could be combined so first of all what if we mitigate the shortcomings of the videos that i made before for facebook live that i'm currently uploading to the new you tube channel by actually removing the video and just using the audio and then the question becomes whoa what visual do we used to go with the audio of those videos and that sounds like where we got to when we were talking about the possibility of tick tock it's not a priority for me but if we're gonna do it at all at any time in the future i'm not really interested in being visual like being a representative for this i want people just to focus on the word so you said sure tick tock channels could be face less and and just have words and sounds so what what if we started thinking differently about the videos that were preparing for face book and then that work might be suitable for them the second platform of tick tock or at least help us get more familiar with like you know what what's the best way to narrow down the message in to sort of a digestible size that could go on you tube or tick tock so you may be thinking about content that goes to both or maybe just the learning from one in a way that will help us create for the other and then here comes my friends idea he said if the idea really is to strip away everything else and just basically have words in the most isolated smallest unit size like i had and shirt and the stuff that will be on zazzle why not look to get some of these some of these sentences listed on quotation web sites and i really like this idea you know quotes about simplicity like i've got some really unique ones and quotes about infinity and quotes about laughter like i've got unique quotes about all of these things so and i don't know which quote web sites would be easier to get onto but there's a bunch of i'm and i don't know the process by which they integrate new quotes but that would be for me a great project to have you work on you know doing research and and then ultimately making submissions that could get the ideas out there in another free platform the by zazzle you know people are looking they're finding my ideas without having to pay to see them so quote website you know free access to these ideas exactly when you're looking for them and then you find speaker a writer whose sharing ideas that are making sense to you are resonating with you are making you curious about more and then that leads people to find done than where i really want to be found which is either like on the main let it be simple website or on my amazon page buying my books or on zazzle so this this feels like a good marketing idea getting it included on quote website so what do you think that what do you think about the you to tick tock kind of overlap at least some when you think about stripping out the visuals of me sitting in my kitchen making making those videos last year
