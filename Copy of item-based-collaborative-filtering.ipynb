It is a form of collaborative filtering that focuses on the similarity between items rather than users.\n","\n","- In item-based collaborative filtering, the recommendations are generated by identifying items that are similar to the ones a user has already shown interest in. The underlying assumption is that if a user likes or interacts with a particular item, they are likely to have similar preferences for other similar items.\n","\n","- The process of item-based collaborative filtering typically involves the following steps:\n","\n","- Data collection: Gather data on user-item interactions, such as ratings, reviews, or purchase history.\n","\n","- Item similarity calculation: Calculate the similarity between items based on various metrics, such as cosine similarity or Pearson correlation. The similarity is usually determined by comparing the ratings or preferences of users who have interacted with both items.\n","\n","- Neighborhood selection: Identify a subset of similar items for each item in the system. This subset, known as the item's neighborhood, consists of items that are most similar to the item in question.\n","\n","- Recommendation generation: Once the item's neighborhood is established, the system can generate recommendations by considering the preferences of similar users. For a given user, the system identifies the items in their neighborhood that the user has not interacted with and recommends those items based on the assumption that the user will likely be interested in them.\n","\n","- Item-based collaborative filtering has several advantages. It is computationally efficient and can handle large datasets and item catalogs. It also performs well when dealing with the \"cold start\" problem, where there is limited information about new users or items. Additionally, it can provide accurate recommendations based on item similarities.\n","\n","- However, item-based collaborative filtering can suffer from the \"sparsity\" problem, where the user-item interaction matrix is sparse, meaning that most users have only interacted with a small fraction of the available items. In such cases, it can be challenging to find a sufficient number of similar items for recommendation.\n","\n","- Overall, item-based collaborative filtering is a popular and effective approach in building recommender systems, particularly in scenarios where item similarities are well-defined and easily calculated."],"metadata":{"id":"4VkFjvawVlEz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["![](https://predictivehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/recommenders_systems.png)"],"metadata":{"id":"RvShBmV8VlE2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Business Problem\n","\n","- An online film viewing platform wants to develop a recommendation system with collaborative filtering.
